This is a sample chatbot created for IMC Government..... All features might not work as due to security reasons can't opensource all the stuff because after it would be owned by the government.
You can Type Hii and select the check url button and paste the url and then it will show that the url is owned by the government or not.. also clicking on imc will answer your questions about the indore city you can alsk anything about the indore city.....

features which would not work
1) url check will only identify gov. owned websites not the others but the actual bot can
2) MP e-tender- MP tender option would be disappeared from this due to api integration and security purpose.
